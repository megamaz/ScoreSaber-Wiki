It is currently being developed by Umbranox and his PPv3 team. Considering the complexity of various elements slowing down the process of making PPv3 available, there is currently no ETA as to when it will come into place.</p><h2 id="why-are-the-ost-maps-not-ranked" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#why-are-the-ost-maps-not-ranked" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Why are the OST maps not ranked?</h2><p>Scores which are submitted to the Beat Saber original soundtracks are not submitted to ScoreSaber for various reasons. This makes them ineligible for ranking as no ScoreSaber leaderboard is available for them to be a part of ranked maps.</p><h2 id="why-are-replays-only-available-on-ranked-maps" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#why-are-replays-only-available-on-ranked-maps" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Why are replays only available on ranked maps?</h2><p>Replays over time take up a very considerable amount of storage space and ScoreSaber only has so much of it in its current state. There are too many maps available and storing all of them would be unhealthy for the well-being of ScoreSaber servers.</p><h2 id="how-do-modifiers-work-with-scoresaber" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#how-do-modifiers-work-with-scoresaber" aria-hidden="true">#</a> How do modifiers work with ScoreSaber?</h2><p>Positive modifiers (Ghost Notes, Disappearing Arrows, Faster Song) are only enabled on both ranked Overkills. You can still set scores on other songs with modifiers, but only your base score is considered for scoring and PP calculations. Negative modifiers (No Fail, Slower Song, etc.), always apply.</p><h2 id="why-not-autorank-every-map" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#why-not-autorank-every-map" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Why not autorank every map?</h2><p>There are many reasons as to this is a bad idea. It was attempted in the past and failed. It took almost a year to clean up all the unplayable and mistimed maps that got auto-ranked. In addition, ScoreSaber\u2019s servers would not be able to handle the processing load of auto-ranking all maps, this goes along the replays being only available to ranked maps.</p><h2 id="i-played-all-these-maps-but-they-give-0pp" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#i-played-all-these-maps-but-they-give-0pp" aria-hidden="true">#</a> I played all these maps but they give 0pp?</h2>',12),m=a("That means the map is most likely not ranked.

The first reason is because players have to put time into a map to get a good score, and would be discouraged from doing that if there is a threat of the map being unranked. The second is because mappers would likely be less inclined to spend the time pushing a map for rank if their map could be unranked. The last reason is because the ranking team would have to check over every map for every new issue outlined in criteria.
