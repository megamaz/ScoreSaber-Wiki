This restriction will last until the mapper has successfully gotten 3 mapsets ranked, in which case the restriction will be lifted. The mapper is allowed to rank any song they choose, including ones that might have been previously deleted by the same mapper, as long as the maps are rankable by current criteria. Maps previously deleted will not automatically be ranked again.</p><p>If a mapper does not wish to be fully unbanned, but will allow other mappers to use their assets such as lighting events and timing, they may apply for a partnership unban. Rules for a partnership unban are as follows: No person unbanned through partnerships may submit their own maps for rank under their name or another. Any map submitted for rank which includes someone unbanned through partnership must not be uploaded onto an account owned by the unbanned person.
